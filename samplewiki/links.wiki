  - within wiki root [[/index]]
  - relative directory [[allegro/../]]
- absolute:
  - [[///tmp/in_root_tmp]]
  - [[//~/.bashrc]] - this one will search for `.bashrc.html` so those are 
    meant for wiki files, not regular one. For those, look below for external

  - [[//$HOME/.bashrc]] - this one is broken on VimWiki parser, possibly some 
    flaw with handling env variables.
