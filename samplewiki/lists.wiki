== Definitions ==

=== Sample definition from VimWiki help ===

{{{
Term 1:: Definition 1
Term 2::
:: Definition 2
:: Definition 3
}}}

Term 1:: Definition 1
Term 2::
:: Definition 2
:: Definition 3

=== Orphaned definition without title ===

{{{
:: there is no title
}}}

:: there is no title

=== Orphaned title without definition ===

{{{
there is no definition::
}}}

there is no definition::

=== Several colons in the line ===

{{{
foo:: bar:baz :: foobar
}}}

foo:: bar:baz :: foobar

=== Valid examples of colon usage and overindentation ===

Here, definition is swallowed by citation in VimWiki. In vw2html it should be
fine.

{{{
   overindented title            :: typical definition
    four space title::    definition with trailing spaces   # there are spaces
title:with:colons::
:: D:efinition with colon
 :: indented definition
}}}

   overindented title            :: typical definition
    four space title::    definition with trailing spaces
title:with:colons::
:: D:efinition with colon
 :: indented definition

=== Multile titles for single definition ===

{{{
multiple ::
terms::
 and::
:: single definition
}}}

multiple ::
terms::
 and::
:: single definition

=== Multiple definition for single title ===

{{{
def1:: multiple definitions
:: another definition
:: and another
}}}

def1:: multiple definitions
:: another definition
:: and another

=== Multiline examples ===

It's not supported on Vimwiki2HTML, but, well it is useful.

{{{
multiline::
:: Definition first sentence,
   sentence continuation

   Multiline second paragraph

   Multiline 3rd paragraph
}}}

multiline::
:: Definition first sentence,
   sentence continuation

   Multiline second paragraph

   Multiline 3rd paragraph

=== Multiline underinddented ===

This will be treated as immediate end of definition list and treated as a
paragraph

{{{
wrong1::
:: definition first par
  underindented continuation - should end definition

wrong2::
:: definition first par
    overindented continuation - should end definition
}}}

wrong1::
:: definition first par
  underindented continuation - should end definition

wrong2::
:: definition first par
    overindented continuation - should end definition

{{{
wrong3::
:: definition first par

  underindented paragraph - should end definition

wrong4::
:: definition first par

    overindented paragraph - should end definition
}}}

wrong3::
:: definition first par

  underindented paragraph - should end definition

wrong4::
:: definition first par

    overindented paragraph - should end definition

=== Multiline with lists ===

Simple multiline definition with list:
{{{
def::
:: term
   * list item 1
   * list item 2
}}}

def::
:: term
   * list item 1
   * list item 2

And another one with nested list:

{{{
def::
:: term
   * list item 1
     * list item 2
   * list item 3
     * list item 4
}}}

def::
:: term
   * list item 1
     * list item 2
   * list item 3
     * list item 4

And finally:

{{{
def::
:: term

   * list item 1
     * list item 2

   another para

   * item 1
   * item 2
   
   and so on

   and last para
}}}


def::
:: term

   * fist item 1
     * list item 2

   another para

   * item 1
   * item 2

   and so on

   and last para

== Not supported ==

=== Ordered list started with letters or roman numbers. ===

Although they are supported in VimWiki, there is no much sense to implement
and use them as all of them are rendered as ordered lists without any custom
class to indicate they are letter-based or roman based numbers.

- Letter based like `a) item`
  a) Numbered list item 1
  b) Numbered list item 2
  c) Numbered list item 3
- Same as above but uppercase
  A) Numbered list item 1
  B) Numbered list item 2
  C) Numbered list item 3
- Roman numbers like `i) item` (not sure if that means it should be
  automatically numbered)
  i) Numbered list item 1
  ii) Numbered list item 2
  iii) Numbered list item 3
- Same as above but uppercase
  I) Numbered list item 1
  II) Numbered list item 2
  III) Numbered list item 3
