== Not supported yet ==

=== Ordered list started with letters or roman numbers. ===

Although they are supported in VimWiki, there is no much sense to implement
and use them as all of them are rendered as ordered lists without any custom
class to indicate they are letter-based or roman based numbers.

- Letter based like `a) item`
  a) Numbered list item 1
  b) Numbered list item 2
  c) Numbered list item 3
- Same as above but uppercase
  A) Numbered list item 1
  B) Numbered list item 2
  C) Numbered list item 3
- Roman numbers like `i) item` (not sure if that means it should be
  automatically numbered)
  i) Numbered list item 1
  ii) Numbered list item 2
  iii) Numbered list item 3
- Same as above but uppercase
  I) Numbered list item 1
  II) Numbered list item 2
  III) Numbered list item 3
