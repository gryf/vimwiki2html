== Alignment ==

Note, that even if it's documented on Vimwiki help page, and it's conveniently
aligned on the wiki itself, Vimwiki2HTML doesn't render it at all - no class,
nor other attributes are applied to the cells. Fortunately, it was rather easy
to implement, and `vw2html` adds appropriate classes for cells (`cell-center`
and `cell-right` are used, while default left is left classless).

{{{
| normal (typically left aligned)  |       center       | right aligned |
|----------------------------------|:------------------:|--------------:|
| and                              |        some        |          data |
| lorem                            |       ipsum        |         data2 |
| Nullam nibh libero, sagittis vel | varius dictum nisl | nisl non augu |
}}}

| lorem                            |       ipsum        |         data2 |
| Nullam nibh libero, sagittis vel | varius dictum nisl | nisl non augu |

== Centered table ==

This isn't described on docs, yet when put any space before first (or all) `|`
table will be centered. Of course, depending on the CSS class `center`
definition, it might be whatever it desired to be - centered, stretched to the
container boundaries, special cell rendering and so on.
